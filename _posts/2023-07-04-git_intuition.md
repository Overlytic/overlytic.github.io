# Getting a better intuition for Git

Even though I wouldn't call myself an expert user, I really love Git. It is just such an elegant source control system. 
However, it can be hard to fix your repository after accidentally running the wrong commands. 
These git issues (or gissues as my colleagues called them) always remind me of the following XKCD comic.

The alt text of the comic states: *"If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. 
Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything."* 

This comic came to mind again when I was asked to give a git training session to new interns.
I really wanted to find a way to transfer the intuition of branches and merging.

By far the best resource I found for this was [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org). 
I really wish I had access to this website when I was learning git. 
It is an interactive javascript website which allows you to run simplified git commands and then visualises their effect on commits (shown as colourful circles).
See the example below.

Lastly, another useful resource for recovering from gissues is [ohsh*tgit](https://ohshitgit.com/)  
This website shows you the git commands to get out of common mistake situations.
